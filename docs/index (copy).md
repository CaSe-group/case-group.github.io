**About us**

The CaSe group - lead by Dr. Christian Brandt - is a young and dynamic team at the [*Institute for Infectious Diseases and Infection Control*](https://www.uniklinikum-jena.de/infektionsmedizin/).
We combine the wet-lab biology (especially nanopore sequencing) with applied bioinformatics (automated workflow development and big data analysis) to address various clinical needs.

We cover various areas of the microbiology:  

 * Antibiotic resistancs in pathogenes
 * Phage detection and therapy
 * Nanopore sequencing
 * RNA-seq
 * SARS-CoV-19 sequencing
 * Identification of plasmids
 * Outbreak investigation

and bioinformatics:  

 * Cloud computing
 * Workflow development
 * Containerisation (docker, singularity)
 * Whole genome sequencing (WGS)
 * Metagenomics
