## plasmid analysis

KPC plasmid clustering workflow via Nextflow starting from accessionnumbers.
Workflow is only tested and intended for KPC-plasmids. 

This repository was used in this work:
> Brandt, C. *et al.* Assessing genetic diversity and similarity of 435 KPC-carrying plasmids. *Scientific Reports* **9**, 11223 (2019) [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-47758-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-47758-5)

However might be of interest for other resistance carrying plasmids.
