ABSTRACT={The phylogenetic tree of the Staphylococcus aureus complex consists of several distinct clades and the majority of human and veterinary S. aureus isolates form one large clade. In addition, two divergent clades have recently been described as separate species. One was named Staphylococcus argenteus, due to the lack of the “golden” pigment staphyloxanthin. The second one is S. schweitzeri, found in humans and animals from Central and West Africa. In late 2021, two additional species, S. roterodami and S. singaporensis, have been described from clinical samples from Southeast Asia. In the present study, isolates and their genome sequences from wild Straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and a Diamond firetail (Stagonopleura guttata, an estrildid finch) kept in a German aviary are described. The isolates possessed staphyloxanthin genes and were closer related to S. argenteus and S. schweitzeri than to S. aureus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were nearly identical to both, S. roterodami and S. singaporensis. We propose considering the study isolates, the recently described S. roterodami and S. singaporensis as well as some Chinese strains with MLST profiles stored in the PubMLST database as different clonal complexes within one new species. According to the principle of priority we propose it should be named S. roterodami. This species is more widespread than previously believed, being observed in West Africa, Southeast Asia and Southern China. It has a zoonotic connection to bats and has been shown to be capable of causing skin and soft tissue infections in humans. It is positive for staphyloxanthin, and it could be mis-identified as S. aureus (or S. argenteus) using routine procedures. However, it can be identified based on distinct MLST alleles, and “S. aureus” sequence types ST2470, ST3135, ST3952, ST3960, ST3961, ST3963, ST3965, ST3980, ST4014, ST4075, ST4076, ST4185, ST4326, ST4569, ST6105, ST6106, ST6107, ST6108, ST6109, ST6999 and ST7342 belong to this species.}

	abstract = {Rapid susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates is crucial for anti-infective therapy, especially in critical cases such as bacteriaemia and sepsis. Nevertheless, empiric therapy is often initiated immediately and without testing because two days and more pass between a positive blood culture and a susceptibility profile, so in the meantime, the most likely pathogens are treated. However, current empiric recommendations are very generic. They often remain unmodified even in light of incoming, early data specific to a patient{\textquoteright}s case, such as positive blood culture microscopy. Part of the hesitancy to change treatments presumably stems from a lack of systematic integration of early information beyond expert intuition. To enable targeted antimicrobial therapy earlier in a case{\textquoteright}s progression, we developed a method to predict antimicrobial susceptibility from microscopy images of bacteria alone. Our proof-of-concept MICNet combines two neural nets in a new chimerical architecture. It is pre-trained on about 100 thousand antibiograms and fine-tuned with only five thousand microscopic images through transfer learning. Predicting susceptibility profiles of four representative species, we show high predictive performance with a mean F-score of nearly 85\%. In addition, several qualitative assessments show that our chimerical net has learned substantial expert knowledge. Therefore, MICNet is the first step towards personalized empiric therapy, combining prior pathogen probabilities with patient-specific data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
